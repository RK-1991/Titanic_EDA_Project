# ðŸ›³ Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns related to survival.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To explore the Titanic passenger data and understand what factors contributed to survival.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter / Google Colab

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Gender played a significant role in survival.
- Passengers in higher classes had better survival rates.
- Missing data was found in Age and Cabin features.

## ðŸ§  What Youâ€™ll Learn
- How to handle missing data
- Data visualization using Seaborn
- Grouping and summarizing data
